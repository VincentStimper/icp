# Interative Closest Point (ICP)

## Introduction

This package is a implementation of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to match point clouds in Tensorflow.
It determines the translation and scale parameter between the datasets along a specified set of axes (see [Zin√üer et al. 
Point Set Registration with Integrated Scale Estimation](http://www5.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/Forschung/Publikationen/2005/Zinsser05-PSR.pdf)).
It can handle datasets of an arbitrary number of dimension and runs on multiple CPUs and on GPU.
